Tetris (derived from "tetramino" and "tennis") - developed by the inventor and developer of the USSR programmer Alexey Pajitnov
on June 6, 1984. 
In this game we use tetramino figures as:
 
 I: four blocks in a straight line.
 
 O: four blocks in a 2×2 square. 
 
 T: a row of three blocks with one added below the center.
 
 J: a row of three blocks with one added below the right side. 
 
 L: a row of three blocks with one added below the left side.
 
 S: two stacked horizontal dominoes with the top one offset to the right. 
 
 Z: two stacked horizontal dominoes with the top one offset to the left.

The S, Z and J, L figures are reflection of the each other.


How to play this game?

Button_RIGHT => move right

Button_Left => move left

Button_Down => move down faster

Button_Up => rotate piece

After every +500 score the speed increases.

move_down_faster => score +1

1 filled row => score +100

2 filled row => score +300

3 filled row => score +500

4 filled row => score +800

Your goal is to fill a row with blocks of figures using the top buttons and collect the most points.


The benefits of playing TETRIS

According to the study Mind research network, regular Tetris game allows you to improve your planning skills, develop critical
thinking, quick mental response. Moreover, Tetris can increase brain size. "Tetris" for the brain is very complicated. A
combination of many brain processes is required: attention, visual and motor coordination, memory. All this should work together
very quickly. Not surprisingly, Tetris develops several areas of the brain. Besides, every time when it is possible to lower the
figure and achieve the disappearance of the level, the person feels satisfied with the solution of the problem. Since the process
is cyclical, it is rather difficult to break away from the game. Аs well as playing tetris helps to overcome post-traumatic
disorder and stress, as well as cravings for drugs, cigarettes and even food.
